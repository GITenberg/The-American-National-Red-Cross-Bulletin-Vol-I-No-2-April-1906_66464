  <h2 class='c013'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>The second Quarterly Bulletin of the American National Red Cross
contains an account of the work of raising funds for the benefit of
the Japanese famine sufferers. The Central Committee desires to call
attention to the great advantages such an organization as the Red
Cross provides at such times. Where the Society had already organized
State Branches these Branches were ready, through their
officers, to notify the public that the Red Cross would receive contributions
for this purpose and that local Red Cross treasurers would
receive the same. Moreover, all expenses for the collection of these
contributions, save those that were borne by the “Christian Herald” in
the collection of its most generous contributions, of which further
mention will be made, have been met by the funds of the Society,
so that every penny contributed has been sent directly by the State
Department, through the United States Embassy at Tokyo, to the
Japanese Red Cross for use in its famine relief work.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the Japanese Red Cross has consented to undertake the disposition
of all famine relief funds sent through the American National
Red Cross, a brief report of some of the work lately accomplished by
this remarkable organization will be of interest and short accounts published
by this Society have been reprinted in this Bulletin.</p>

<p class='c015'>The April Quarterly Bulletin having to go to press early in March,
it is impossible to publish the list of contributors to the Famine Fund,
but it is hoped this may be done in the following number.</p>

<p class='c015'>The American National Red Cross should have a large sustaining
membership to enable it to create a thoroughly efficient organization
and at the same time to accumulate an Emergency Fund to meet immediately
the first relief work after any sudden disaster in any of the
States or Territories.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>On March 7, the Red Cross received a communication from the State
Department to the effect that the Governor of the Islands of French
Oceanica, which on February 8th met with a most serious disaster from
a cyclone, had solicited subscriptions for the aid of the people there. As
the Red Cross was collecting contributions for the Japanese Famine Fund,
it most reluctantly had to decline to act in this second matter of relief
work. If the Society had a membership, as it should have in this country,
of a hundred thousand, it would receive into its Emergency Fund fifty
thousand dollars annually which would enable it to render aid at such
times of distant disaster without issuing special appeals and this without
costing its members anything in addition to their annual membership dues
of one dollar. This large membership must be obtained by the efforts
of the present members, and if each member would do whatever he or
she may be able to do towards increasing the membership, the American
National Red Cross would soon have an organization worthy of the
United States and always have in its treasury a fund that would enable
it to reply promptly to any such appeal as that forwarded to it by the
Department of State.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>JAPANESE FAMINE FUND</h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>Acting upon receipt of a letter with enclosures from Judge W. W.
Morrow, President of the California Red Cross Branch, the Central
Committee sent out Saturday, February 10th, to the secretaries of the
Red Cross Branches the following appeal:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Through the California Branch, the American National Red Cross
has received from American residents in Japan an appeal for the
famine-stricken people in three northern provinces of that country.
In one province the rice crop has yielded only 12 per cent. of the
average, and the sentence of death hangs over a quarter of a million
of people if forgotten and unaided. In the eastern portion of another
province the yield is only 15 per cent. and 500,000 people are in great
distress and on the verge of absolute starvation, and in the third province
it is certain that over 100,000 persons cannot live without speedy
and prolonged aid.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Already thousands in these provinces are reduced to shrub roots
and the bark of trees by which mere life may for a time be sustained,
but at the least calculation 680,000 people are now facing extreme
conditions. What this means for their poor women and children, we
who live in the center of this oncoming misery find no words to describe.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hundreds of thousands of persons are on the verge of starvation
and winter is adding its rigors to the distress. Snow having hidden
away the roots and herbs of the forests from the hands of the stricken
people, speedy death or physical anguish worse than death confronts
them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“During the late war, the great European Red Cross Societies did
much to aid the Japanese Red Cross in its work of caring for the sick
and wounded, but our American National Red Cross, just beginning
its reorganization, could be of no assistance. Now the opportunity
arises for us to send to those brave famine-stricken people some assistance
from our abundance. The American National Red Cross

for the relief of these provinces such contributions as the public at
large or any of its own members desire to make.</p>

<p class='c018'>About the same time information was received by the State Department
at Washington through our consuls in Japan of the very serious
conditions in these northern provinces, and with his accustomed
promptness President Roosevelt issued a public appeal, as follows:</p>

<p class='c018'>“The famine situation in northern Japan is proving much more
serious than at first supposed, and thousands of persons are on the
verge of starvation. It is a calamity such as may occasionally befall
any country.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Nations, like men, should stand ever ready to aid each other in
distress, and I appeal to the American people to help from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>abundance their suffering fellowmen of the great and friendly nation
of Japan. I recommend that contributions for this purpose be sent
to the American National Red Cross, which will forward such funds
to the Japanese Red Cross to be used as the Japanese Government
may direct.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Contributions can be made to the local Red Cross treasurers or
sent direct to Hon. Charles Hallam Keep, Red Cross Treasurer,
United States Treasury Department, Washington, D.C.</p>
<div class='c020'>“Theodore Roosevelt.”</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Eki Hioki, the Japanese Chargé d’Affaires, was requested to
inquire if the Japanese Red Cross would undertake the disposition of
the funds forwarded by the American National Red Cross, and after
communicating with his Government sent the following reply:</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have the pleasure to inform you that I have received a cable
message, in reply to mine, from the Japanese Minister of Foreign
Affairs, to the effect that the Japanese Red Cross Society will be delighted
to take charge of the disposition of the relief fund which the
American National Red Cross may send hereafter.</p>
<p class='c021'>“Very truly yours,</p>
<p class='c022'>“Eki Hioki,</p>
<p class='c023'>“Chargé d’Affaires.”</p>

<p class='c024'>The “Christian Herald” of New York, having already been aware
of the distress in Japan, had begun among its Christian readers a subscription
for the purposes of relief, and no sooner did the President’s
appeal appear than the American National Red Cross Treasurer, Hon.
Charles Hallam Keep, received from Dr. Louis Klopsch, Editor of the
“Christian Herald,” a most prompt and generous check for $10,000,
already contributed by its readers, to be forwarded to the Japanese
Red Cross to be used exclusively for the purchase of food supplies.
This amount was immediately cabled by the State Department,
through our Embassy at Tokyo. A few days later the “Christian
Herald” followed its first donation by another check for $10,000, sent
directly to the State Department to be forwarded without delay, as
the need was so great, to the Japanese Red Cross for the purchase
of food. The readers of the “Christian Herald” may justly feel that
by their promptness and generosity they have saved many of their
fellowmen from suffering and death by starvation, and this will be
sincerely appreciated in Japan.</p>

<p class='c015'>In these northern provinces many of the people are living upon
briquettes made of 75 per cent. straw and 25 per cent. foreign rice,
or upon roots, bark of trees, acorns, etc. The Japanese Government,
in spite of its immense war debt, has been remitting or postponing
taxes and at the same time trying to raise money for the purpose of
providing work for the able-bodied so as not to pauperize them, and
food and clothes for the children, old people and sick; but without
outside aid the herculean task will be too heavy a burden.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Frederick Palmer, the War Correspondent representing “Collier’s
Weekly,” served through the Russo-Japanese war with the soldiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>from the famine-stricken districts in the northern provinces of
Japan. He knows these people, their sterling qualities and the bitterness
of their need, and of them he says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“From the heart of the famine-district came the second division
of the Japanese Army, known as ‘The Division which always attacks.’
It exemplified in its character the fine and simple qualities of the
people of the Sendai country, their loyalty, pride, courage, industry,
and equability of temper. The second of the divisions to leave Japan
for the field, it marched through Korea in midwinter to the Battle of
the Yalu, and it was the strong, dependable arm of General Kuroki’s
army which never gave ground to the close of the campaign.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not until December and January of this year, the third winter
since their departure, would transportation arrangements permit the
division’s departure from Manchuria, which was a bleak and inhospitable
land to these simple country boys who were accustomed to
their own beautiful landscape, their clean mats and ornamental gardens.
No heroes ever received a sadder welcome home, for they returned
to find their mothers and sisters and wives wanting food. The
absence of the men who had served their country so well meant the
absence of so many able-bodied tillers of the soil. This and a cold
and unusually rainy summer made the rice crop the scantiest for generations.</p>

<p class='c018'>“These proud northern people have not the facility of city people
in accepting charity. If you went into their houses you would find
that they would deny that they were hungry and possibly offer you
their last bowl of rice to show that they needed no help. The home
department of the Japanese Government is taking measures of practical
relief by offering employment on public works which will increase
the acreage for rice growing and otherwise improve the
agricultural resources of the region. The opportunity is offered for
foreigners to supplement the government aid by private aid which will
be sympathetically and practically administered by the Japanese Red
Cross Society. If it be the duty of the Red Cross to soften the cruel
consequences of war, then it has here a duty as imperative as under
the more sensational surroundings of the battle field.”</p>

<p class='c024'>On February 28th The American National Red Cross transmitted
to the State Department $5,000, which immediately cabled this amount,
through the United States Embassy at Tokyo, to the Japanese Red
Cross to be applied to the famine relief work.</p>

<p class='c015'>In a second appeal issued by the foreign relief committee of northern
Japan, this committee says:</p>

<p class='c017'>“When we issued our first appeal to the foreign communities of
Japan in December, the impending calamity was on so vast a scale
that we ourselves could hardly believe the official statements of 680,000
people in starving condition. Since then the members of our
committee have been through the provinces, and now we must say
that the above figures are too weak to represent the existing misery
and that the wretchedness and suffering are simply appalling. As to
the score of villages, the conditions of all we visited are pitiable in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>extreme. There are able-bodied men clothed in thin, ragged garments,
who have to face the piercing winds and snow to bring in from the
mountains the coal and wood on the price of which labor their thinly-clad
families are trying to eke out a living. There are mothers giving
their very lives to keep their babies warm, themselves exposed to
stinging blasts that must rapidly shorten life. There are even cultured
old men and women, who in former days were in comparative
comfort, but now are reduced to physical destitution that no words
can describe. There are children bare-footed in the snow, whose
scanty clothing and pinched faces tell the sad tale of only one meal a
day and that of straw and daikon leaves in which is mixed a little
cheap rice flour.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But there is no need of further statements in this line. Rather
we rejoice that there is another side. Amid all this widespread
wretchedness there is a strong spirit of hope and helpfulness. There
is a village called Devil’s Head, snowed under eight feet, leaving 156
people without a particle of food of any kind. Immediately the neighbors,
but little better off, raised 60 yen (about $30), by means of which
pittance the lives of these 156 persons are insured for three weeks
until other aid can come. It is a privilege, indeed, to send a grain
of comfort to such people by our timely and sympathetic gifts, especially
when such aid is so highly appreciated by all and so gratefully
received by those who are losing hope. The one great thing needed
to save the lives of children and aged is money. All that we earnestly
desire is that every sympathetic heart should know the facts and use
any channel that promises to bring speedy relief to even a few hundred
among the many hundreds of thousands who are in dire distress.”</p>

<p class='c024'>On March 6th the American National Red Cross sent, through the
State Department, to the Japanese Red Cross, $5,000, and on March
8th the “Christian Herald” forwarded its third $10,000 contribution.
On March 12th the Red Cross again sent $5,000 and on March 15 $5,000,
so that the amount collected and sent by the Red Cross up to March 15th
amounts to $20,000, and this with the $30,000 sent by the “Christian
Herald” through the American National Red Cross makes a total up to
the last given date of $50,000.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Japanese Government has expressed its great appreciation of
President Roosevelt’s appeal for its famine-stricken provinces, and
press despatches show that the Japanese people also are deeply appreciative
of the sympathy expressed in their trouble by the contributions
from the American people.</p>

<p class='c015'>This Society hopes, in some later issues of the Bulletin, to be able
to give reports of the relief work done by the Japanese Red Cross.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>Just as the <span class='sc'>Bulletin</span> goes to press the American National Red Cross
has received from the “Christian Herald” a check for $50,000 making in
all $80,000 contributed through this paper for the Famine Fund and bringing
the total amount sent to the Japanese Red Cross by March 16th up to
$100,000.</p>

<p class='c015'>An Act to incorporate the American National Red Cross.</p>

<p class='c015'>Whereas, on the twenty-second of August, eighteen hundred and
sixty-four, at Geneva, Switzerland, plenipotentiaries respectively representing
Italy, Baden, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, France,
Prussia, Saxony, and Wurttemberg and the Federal Council of Switzerland,
agreed upon ten articles of a treaty or convention for the
purpose of mitigating the evils inseparable from war; of ameliorating
the condition of soldiers wounded on the field of battle, and particularly
providing, among other things, in effect, that persons
employed in hospitals and in according relief to the sick and wounded
and supplies for this purpose shall be deemed neutral and entitled to
protection; and that a distinctive and uniform flag shall be adopted
for hospitals and ambulances and convoys of sick and wounded and
an arm badge for individuals neutralized; and</p>

<p class='c015'>Whereas, said treaty has been ratified by all of said nations, and
by others subsequently, to the number of forty-three or more, including
the United States of America; and</p>

<p class='c015'>Whereas, the International Conference of Geneva of eighteen hundred
and sixty-three recommended “that there exist in every country
a committee whose mission consists in co-operating in times of war
with the hospital service of the armies by all means in its power”;
and</p>

<p class='c015'>Whereas, a permanent organization is an agency needed in every
nation to carry out the purposes of said treaty, and especially to secure
supplies and to execute the humane objects contemplated by said
treaty, with the power to adopt and use the distinctive flag and arm
badge specified by said treaty in article seven, on which shall be the

Committee of Relief for the Wounded in War); and</p>

<p class='c015'>Whereas, in accordance with the requirements and customs of said
international body such an association adopting and using said insignia

in July, eighteen hundred and eighty-one, known as “The American
National Association of the Red Cross,” re-incorporated April seventeenth,
eighteen hundred and ninety-three, under the laws of the
District of Columbia, and re-incorporated by Act of Congress in
June, nineteen hundred; and</p>

<p class='c025'>THE RED CROSS SOCIETY OF JAPAN HAS ISSUED
THE FOLLOWING REPORTS OF THE
RED CROSS WORK SINCE THE OUTBREAK
OF THE RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR UP TO SEPTEMBER,
1905.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>War is the most dreadful thing that mankind ever witnesses. It is
a horror in itself. So many men have been killed, wounded and invalided
on both sides in our present war in the course of ten months
that one is aghast at the number of casualties.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Red Cross Society of Japan has been strenuously performing
its duty of caring for the sick and wounded ever since the war broke
out regardless, as a matter of course, to which colors the sufferers
belong only remembering the principles of Humanity and Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first work we undertook on the outbreak of the war was to look
after the Russian sailors, who had been wounded during the naval
battle off Chemulpo, Korea.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wounded sailors, who were on board the Russian cruiser,
<i>Varyag</i>, numbering twenty-four persons were taken first to the French
cruiser, <i>Pascal</i>, and then to a temporary hospital that had been hastily
established at Chemulpo by our Society. For twenty-two days, those
sailors were entirely under the care of the hospital, in which, of
course, all necessary treatment was given to them. Unfortunately,
however, two of the patients died and the rest when convalescent
were brought to a hospital at Matsuyama, Japan. There we gave
them further treatment, which resulted in their complete recovery,
although five out of the twenty-two were unfortunately obliged to
have their hands or legs operated upon and cut off.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her Majesty the Empress hearing about these cases has graciously
furnished them with artificial limbs. When they had so far recovered,
the Japanese Government sent them back to their homes in Russia.
The Russian Government sent us a letter of grateful thanks for what
we had done, offering, in addition, through the French Consul at
Seoul, Korea, to defray all the expenses incurred. As we refused the
offer, the Russian Government subscribed 2,000.00 Yen instead to our
relief funds, which we accepted with appreciation.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>No sooner had we been instructed by the Army to get our two
hospital ships, <i>Hakuai Maru</i> and <i>Kosai Maru</i>, in readiness than they
were prepared for embarkation. The names of the vessels had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>intimated to Russia by the authorities in accordance with the rules
of the Hague Convention.</p>

<p class='c015'>The <i>Hakuai Maru</i> on the 21st of February, and the <i>Kosai Maru</i> on
the 25th of the same month, sailed for Ujina, thence forward being
continuously engaged in the transportation of the sick and wounded
of both belligerents between Japan and different ports in Korea and
Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c015'>The increase in the number of the sufferers has naturally kept pace
with the progress of the war and in consequence nine more hospital
ships had to be prepared in which twenty-one relief detachments of
our Society are now working under the direction of an Army surgeon.
On land, we have already dispatched over eighty-two relief
detachments to districts where they are required in Korea and Manchuria
and also to the hospital of both Army and Navy at home.
Several of these detachments are solely engaged in caring for the
Russian prisoners.</p>

<p class='c015'>It may be well to state that one relief detachment consists of</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c026'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>2 Surgeons</div>
      <div class='line in1'>1 Apothecary</div>
      <div class='line in1'>1 Clerk</div>
      <div class='line in1'>2 Chief nurses (men or women)</div>
      <div class='line'>20 Nurses (men or women)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>When several detachments are dispatched to one place, one Director,
one Superintending surgeon and one Superintending nurse are placed
as supervisors over all such detachments. Not infrequently, however,
it becomes necessary to divide one relief detachment into two or
more. All relief detachments to be sent to the front, it must be noted,
consist of men only; those at home of women nurses; and those on
board the hospital ships are of both sexes, namely, one detachment
of women nurses and one or two detachments of men nurses, the
number of which is fixed proportionately to the size of the capacity
of the ships.</p>

<p class='c015'>According to the regulations of our relief service in time of war,
there are Patients’ Transport Columns but never before have they
been used until the present war. We have now organized one such
column on trial, selecting the stretcher-bearers out of the retired

<p class='c015'>The total number of all the detachments as mentioned above and
already sent out together with women nurses amounts to 3,266 persons
and, moreover, we are prepared to dispatch as many more as are
necessary at any moment.</p>

<p class='c015'>All the women nurses of our society go through scientific and practical
training for two and three years, the latter term being for the
higher course of nursing, whilst the men nurses are required to take
a ten months’ course of training.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our Main Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo has now been appropriated
to the use of the Army. It is, therefore, made a branch hospital of
the Tokyo Military Reserve Hospital. Since the outbreak of the
war, many additional barracks have been built on the wide ground
of the Red Cross Hospital. Moreover, an estate we had purchased
at Hiroshima for the purpose of building our hospital there has been
put at the disposal of the Army and a temporary hospital has been
erected.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>The Ladies’ Volunteer Nursing Association of the Red Cross
Society of Japan has become more active in many ways, the members
have applied themselves with far greater earnestness and energy to
the study of first aid and nursing under the direction of our medical
men. Moreover, they are occupying themselves very busily every
day making various kinds of bandages and caps for the patients,
looking after them at the relief stations, which are prepared for those
who are travelling, visiting them at the hospitals, helping them to
write to their families at home and in various other serviceable ways.
Theirs is a self-sacrificing work.</p>

<p class='c015'>Since the outbreak of the war, the number of the members is daily
increasing. Princesses, the wives of the Nobility and of the diplomatic
staffs and other distinguished ladies have all joined.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her Majesty the Empress has always been greatly interested in
our relief work. On the 20th of last June, for instance, she paid a
visit to the Ladies’ Volunteer Nursing Association and particularly
looked at the members making bandages. On the 3d of September,
she summoned our president to the palace and spoke to him very
encouragingly about the Red Cross Work.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>Our sister societies abroad have earnestly and practically extended
their sympathy and kindness to us by offering gifts in various forms,
which we have gratefully accepted. The following are the details of
gifts we have received up to date:</p>

<p class='c027'>  9 cases of bandage materials and clothes from the Red Cross Society
      of Germany.</p>
<p class='c027'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>515 cases of various kinds of wine and nourishment from the Red
      Cross Society of Italy.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Red Cross Society of Spain and the National Red Cross Society
of America have kindly offered us their assistance. Besides
these public gifts, many individual men and women have come forward
and offered us their services to nurse the wounded soldiers.</p>

<p class='c015'>We deeply regret that we are not able to accept these kind offers
at present, simply because we have still a sufficient number of well
equipped relief corps to meet all the emergencies we have had as yet
to encounter.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, the Government of Japan accepted the services of Mrs.
McGee, an American lady, with nine nurses, and Mrs. Richardson,
an English lady, to nurse the sick and wounded and instructed us to
place them among some of our relief detachments. The American
nurses have been working in the Hiroshima Reserve Hospital and on
some hospital ships for a few months and sailed for their homes
recently with Mrs. McGee.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>At the close of this statement, we take great pleasure in adding
that donations in various forms from every part of the world and
from rich and poor have ever been flowing into the coffers of our
Society. We have never failed to appropriate these gifts to our relief
funds in compliance with the donors’ wishes.</p>

<p class='c015'>We shall be always grateful for these practical expressions of sympathy
and generosity which are extended to both belligerents, for
whose comfort and relief, when sick and wounded, we are most
earnestly praying and devoting ourselves. May Providence help our
cause.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>Since the issue of our last report on the Red Cross work, much
progress has been made in all the different ways of alleviating the
sufferings of the war-victims, seventeen Relief detachments on hospital
ships and twenty-two on land being dispatched in addition to
those which had previously been in service since the outbreak of the
Russo-Japanese war. The following are the details of the institutions in
which our Relief detachments are at present working:</p>

<p class='c015'>In addition to such institutions, there are thirteen agencies at home
and one at the front established by the Headquarters of the Society
in order to facilitate the management of the whole Relief detachments
at home and abroad, numbering 152 Relief detachments in all;
and of Relief stations established in such ports and railway stations
as are convenient and necessary for giving rest and refreshment to
the sick and wounded on their homeward way and also medical treatment
in cases of emergency, to say nothing of renewing bandages.
These are worked voluntarily by the members of the branches of the
Red Cross Society of Japan, surgeons, nurses and the members of the
Ladies’ Volunteer Nursing Association.</p>

<p class='c015'>The nurses of both sexes, dispatched up to date, number in all over
4,700, five Relief detachments out of which have been formed and
placed entirely in the Russian prisoners’ hospitals and stations. The
approximate amount of the expense for the work up to the end of
this year is estimated to be as much as 5,160,000 Yen.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>The members of the Ladies’ Volunteer Nursing Association of the
Red Cross Society of Japan have constantly and strenuously rendered
their services ever since the outbreak of the war in making bandages
and caps for the patients, in looking after them at the relief stations,
which we have already mentioned, in visiting them at the hospitals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in helping them to write to their families at home, in distributing
among them books, magazines, newspapers and various things they
could collect, in actually nursing the sick and wounded of both belligerents,
if necessary, and in various other ways. The members of
forty-one branches, together with those of the headquarters of the
Association number nearly 10,000, including Princesses, the wives of
the Nobility and of diplomatic staffs and other distinguished ladies
who have joined.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>Their Majesties, the Emperor and the Empress and their Highnesses,
the Crown Prince and Princess have always been greatly interested
in our relief work. Especially the Empress has graciously
encouraged the members in various ways, giving, for instance, money
to the Association and visiting it to look at the members making
bandages. When she summoned Count Matsugata, the President,
to the palace on the 3d of September of last year, the following was
graciously spoken to him:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>It is gratifying that the Red Cross Society of Japan has dispatched a
great number of Relief detachments, by whom both Japanese and Russian
sick and wounded have been attended. We hope you will encourage these
detachments in their work and that the relief work, true to the principle
of philanthropy, will be thoroughly accomplished by them.</i>”</p>

<p class='c018'>Again, on the 4th of March of this year when Baron Ozawa, Vice-President,
paid an homage to the Empress previous to his departure
from Japan for the front to visit the sufferers officially and to inspect
all the Relief detachments there, she spoke to him as follows:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“<i>Over one year has now passed away since the Red Cross Society has
started its relief work. We can imagine how hard it must be for the
members of the Relief detachments at the front especially at this coldest
season of the year. Still, the care of the sick and wounded concerns my
heart evermore. We wish you would convey to the Relief detachments
my earnest hope that they will endure all the difficulties and work hard in
alleviating the suffering of the patients.</i>”</p>

<p class='c018'>Indeed, it is not little that the Japanese ladies have done for the
prestige of the nation as well as for humanity during the Russo-Japanese
war.</p>

<hr class='c033' />

<p class='c015'>Our sister-societies have earnestly and practically extended their
sympathy and kindness to us by offering gifts in various forms, which
we have gratefully accepted. The following are the details of gifts
we have received since last October up to this date. (Gifts from
other institutions or individuals are omitted here).</p>

<p class='c015'>The Red Cross Society of Germany, with the permission of our
Government, has kindly sent out Professor Dr. Adolph Henle and Dr.
Otto Fittig accompanied by a nurse, Miss Margarethe von Sommogy,
to our country to render assistance towards relieving the sufferings
of the sick and wounded. Since last March, they have been
working at a military branch hospital in Sendagaya, Tokyo, in co-operation
with our own surgeons and nurses.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>A party of American nurses under Mrs. McGee mentioned briefly
in our last report, sailing from Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., on the
3d of March, arrived in Yokohama on the 22d of April, 1904. They
commenced work on May 31st in the Hiroshima Reserve hospital
where they remained till October 10th, 1904. During that time, they
were in turn placed on board hospital ships that had been running
between Japan and Manchuria.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>In compliance with Mrs. McGee’s request, we sent her out to the
Matsuyama Hospital, in which Russian prisoners had been placed and
to a naval hospital at Kure; and to some districts in Korea where
there were field hospitals.</p>

<p class='c015'>She then returned to America together with the other nurses, who
sailed from Nagasaki on the 21st of October, 1904. We offered to
Mrs. McGee and to each one of the nurses the sum of Yen 200.00
as a token of our appreciation of their services.</p>

<p class='c015'>The following nurses:</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c034'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Miss Minnie Cooke,</div>
      <div class='line'>Miss Mary Gladwin,</div>

      <div class='line'>Miss Elizabeth Kratz,</div>
      <div class='line'>Miss Adelaide Mackereth,</div>

      <div class='line'>Miss Sophia Newell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Miss Genevieve Russell,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>returned the money to the Society saying that they could not bear to
carry any of the Red Cross money with them back to their homes.</p>
<p class='c015'>As a further mark of our appreciation of their devotedness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>earnestness in caring for the sick and wounded on land and sea, we
invited the nurses to join the Society as Special Members.</p>

<p class='c015'>(Special membership shall be offered to those who have rendered distinguished
services or made a donation of not less than 200 Yen, to the
Society.)</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Cooke, Miss King, Miss Mackereth and Miss Russell have
made a subscription towards the Relief Funds of this Society since
they returned home.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Richardson, an English lady, worked in the hospitals in Tokyo
and Hiroshima for about one year and half, arriving in Japan in April,
1904, and leaving Yokohama for England on the 15th of July, 1905.
During this time she worked entirely at her own expense.</p>

<p class='c015'>She made visits to the military hospitals in Nagoya, Osaka, Kokura,
Kumamoto, Matsuyama, Kure and Sasebo and also to those in Dalny
and Port Arthur. In April of this year, she was placed on board hospital
ships carrying the sick and wounded from the front to Japan.
Her sympathy and kindness had been shown, not only by her actually
nursing the war-victims but also by her giving them such things as
might interest and comfort them and by more than once making subscriptions
towards the Relief Funds of the Society.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upon her departure from Japan, the Empress received her at the
palace. Prince Kan-in, Honorary President of the Red Cross Society
of Japan, and Princess Kan-in, Honorary President of the Ladies’
Volunteer Nursing Association, gave her a farewell dinner at their
residence.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>As the fall of Port Arthur had been expected by all the people, we
had sent previously 3,000 suits of patients’ dresses, together with a
proper number of blankets and kept them at the nearest possible
place to the fort so that we could be ready to provide the Russian
wounded with such things when needed. These things, as we
thought, have been of a great use. When Baron Ozawa took the
opportunity of paying a visit to General Walaschof, the President
of the Russian Red Cross Hospital at Port Arthur, the latter not
merely expressed his high appreciation of what had been done by our
Society (offering an honorable medal to Baron Ozawa and also one
to Count Matsugata, the President), but also asked him if the Red
Cross Society of Japan would take over the hospital from the Russian
Red Cross Society. Baron Ozawa, however, refused the offer only
accepting the medal conferred upon him.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c015'>At the close of this account, we take great pleasure in adding that
donations, in various shapes from every part of the world and from
rich and poor, annual subscriptions and the number of members have
ever been increasing. The members of the Society numbering in all
1,035,000, include Japanese and foreigners in China, Korea, Hawaii,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and in other foreign countries. Nevertheless, the expenditure we have
had to defray for the Relief work increases to an amount those outside
can hardly imagine. We have been trying to the utmost of our power
to perform our duty of caring for the helpless patients of both belligerents
ever since the war broke out, only remembering the principles
of Humanity and Brotherhood and we will do so more and
more hereafter under the guidance of Providence and through the
assistance of friends.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>NOTES FROM BRANCH SOCIETIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>The Connecticut Branch is organizing a subdivision in New Haven
and expects to complete the organization in a few days with a membership
of 150 or more. A large subdivision is also being formed at Norwich.
The Bristol subdivision, which is the only one of its kind in the
country, being composed entirely of boys, has sent a generous contribution
to the Japanese famine fund. The “Hartford Courant” has been
most energetic and successful in its collections for the famine fund and
the National Treasurer has received a number of contributions from
that paper.</p>

<p class='c015'>General Charles Bird, U.S.A., President of the Delaware Branch,
writes:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Delaware Branch of the American National Red Cross has
effected a complete organization with a strong membership committee
and a sub-committee to act with the Executive Committee in arranging
for the enrollment of surgeons, physicians and trained nurses to be ready
to respond to a call for any emergency. The work of these committees
is hampered somewhat on account of a lack of public interest, growing
out of the fact that there does not seem to be any active work for the
Red Cross at present. Efforts are being made to increase the interest
on the ground of being prepared for the emergency when it comes. The
subdivisions in the lower part of the State are well organized and ready
to work when calls are made upon them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The District of Columbia Branch is preparing to hold a mass meeting
on March 30th at the Belasco Theatre in Washington, at which Secretary
of War Taft and several other prominent speakers will deliver addresses
on the subject of the Red Cross. It is also expected that two Army
Surgeons who were present with the Russian and Japanese Armies in
Manchuria will speak of what they saw of Red Cross work during the
late war in the Far East.</p>

<p class='c015'>Subdivisions of the Illinois Branch have recently been organized at
Danville, Aurora and Rock Island, with a membership of over one hundred
at Danville. Since the publication of the Annual Report of the Red
Cross, Illinois has reported the enrollment of a number of doctors and
nurses.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Secretary of the Maine Branch reports that that Society is “slowly
but surely improving and getting ready to do good work.” Earnest efforts
are being made to increase the membership.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Maryland Branch, like the District of Columbia Branch, contemplates
holding a mass meeting on the 5th of April. These meetings are
expected to arouse much interest and assist considerably in enlarging
the membership.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Massachusetts Branch “is too busily engaged with the famine
fund to write much for the Bulletin.” The Bulletin is glad of this opportunity
to congratulate the Massachusetts Branch upon its successful
efforts in behalf of the Japanese famine sufferers. Massachusetts ranks
first among the Branch Societies in amount contributed for this fund.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The New York State Branch has appointed Mr. William Chauncy
Langdon, Secretary of the Executive Committee, and Mr. Langdon is
actively engaged in organizing subdivisions throughout the State. Subdivisions
have already been formed in Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo,
and Brooklyn, in Oneida and Westchester Counties, and in Islip
Township of Long Island. The Oneida County Subdivision has the largest
membership, 155, 12 of whom are life members. The total membership
in New York State is 790.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Cleveland Subdivision of the Ohio Branch reports the enrollment
of a number of doctors and nurses.</p>

<p class='c015'>On March 14th “The Pennsylvania Branch of the American National
Red Cross” was organized, with headquarters in Philadelphia. The following
officers were elected: President, Talcott Williams; treasurer, Mrs.
A. J. Cassatt; vice-presidents, Captain John S. Muckle, Miss Anne
Thompson, Hon. H. Kirke Porter, of Pittsburg; Hon. Vance McCormick,
of Harrisburg; Bishop Alexander Mackay-Smith and George H. Frazier;
secretary, Joseph Allison Steinmetz.</p>

<p class='c015'>Money sent by the American National Red Cross to the Philippine
Branch for the typhoon sufferers has been gratefully acknowledged by
that Society. The practical sympathy thus shown for the unfortunate
sufferers from that disaster conclusively and promptly proved the value
of the Red Cross organization. The Philippine Branch has reported
recently over one hundred members.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Secretary of the Rhode Island Branch writes:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Rhode Island Branch is receiving cordial support from the community.
The number of annual members is increasing, as is also the
number of life members. The subscriptions for the relief of the Japanese
sufferers have been liberal and gifts are still coming into the fund for
that purpose.”</p>

<p class='c015'>From letters and newspaper reports received from South Carolina, it
is evident that the officers are actively engaged in building up the Society.
We have also been informed that a considerable sum has been collected
for the Japanese Famine Fund.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Central Committee hopes soon to be able to report the formation
of a State Branch in New Jersey and several other States.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Executive Committee of the American National Red Cross some
time ago appointed a sub-committee to select a design and material for
a new form of Life Membership Certificate. These will be ready for issue
soon, and life members who have received the old form of certificate will
be furnished with the new certificate upon application.</p>

<p class='c015'>A design of Red Cross pin to be worn by the members has been
adopted, and arrangements will soon be completed whereby all members
desiring pins or buttons will be able to procure them.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

</div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
